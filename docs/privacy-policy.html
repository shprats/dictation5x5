    <p>Dictation5x5 ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application (the "App").</p>

    <h3>3.3 Sign in with Apple</h3>
    <p>If you choose to sign in with Apple, Apple processes your authentication. Apple's use of your data is governed by their Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>

        <li><strong>Cloud Storage:</strong> Your account information (email, display name) is stored securely in Firebase's cloud infrastructure.</li>
        <li><strong>Security Measures:</strong> We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your information, including encryption in transit and at rest.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> We retain your account information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide services.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Data:</strong> Audio recordings and transcripts stored on your device remain on your device until you delete them or uninstall the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> When you delete your account, we will delete your account information from our systems. Local data on your device will remain until you delete it or uninstall the App.</li>
    </ul>
